Part 1: find a bad plot and a good plot by looking through papers on https://journals.plos.org/plosone/Links to an external site.
. Download the image or screenshot it and post it to your HW7 README.md. The README.md should contain each of the two images, a description of why it is good/bad based on the criteria discussed in class for data and scientific visualizations.
Part 2: take a plot from any of the homeworks and redesign it to improve it. Post the old version and the new version on the same README and discuss the changes you made, the reason for them, and how they improve the plot. Make sure the caption of the final plot is complete: include WHAT is being plotted and how to allow the reader to understand the plot and WHY its being plotted: what is interesting, what is noticeable about the data/result.
Part 3: next week your plots will be assigned to two classmates for review (HW8)
