## HW1: LOGISTIC REGRESSION 
Perform all tasks as indicated in the notebook - only tasks in bold need to be completed. the other tasks are completed within the notebook, but you need to review them.

Task 1: general data exploration
Task 2: Preprocess the target variable (binary)
all variables need to be transformed into numeric values: for the binary target: 0/1
Task 3: Preprocess the other variables
choose four features to use as input
**TODO 1: Write a caption for Fig 1**
Task 3a: preprocess numerical features
Min-Max Normalization:
**TODO 2: write a caption here for fig 2**
Task 3b: preprocess categorical features
One-Hot Encoding
**TODO 3: describe what each feature in the dataframe represents (use the descriptions in the intro)**
Task 4: Model: Logistic Regression
**TODO 4: make and fit a logistic regression to the problenm**
**TODO 5: Model Evaluation: measure the accuracy of the model**
**TODO 6: write a table caption: using the slides describe what each quantity above describes**
**TODO 7: write a descriptive caption for the plot above**
