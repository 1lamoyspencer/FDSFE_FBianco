_Analyzing outliers: influential or nuisance?_



## HW1: REVIEW THE LINEAR REGRESSION NOTEBOOK (you need it for HW 2)
There is only one cell to finish in the notebook https://github.com/fedhere/FDSFE_FBianco/blob/main/HW5/linear_regression_in_detail.ipynb. This was done in class as a lab in two lectures (you can see the recording if you missed anything). The only portion for you to fill is the p-value based comparison of the line and parabola model fit: which is better? What is the Null Hypothesis of the likelihood ratio test? Does the value you get from the test lead to rejection of the null or not?

## HW2: MULTILINEAR REGRESSION 
Perform all tasks as indicated in the notebook https://github.com/fedhere/FDSFE_FBianco/blob/main/HW5/Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb
